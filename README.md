# Hollow Night

## An attempt at remaking **Hollow Knight** from **Team Cherry** for a project aimed at improving my OOP/Java skills.

All assets were made in GIMP/Paint.NET.
For starting the project I used the "2D Game Programming on Java Tutorial" by [***CodeNMore***](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLah6faXAgguMnTBs3JnEJY0shAc18XYQZ) on **YouTube**.

To play the game simply clone the repository into your preferred IDE and run Launcher.java. I am using IntelliJ IDEA and cannot guarantee that it will work with other IDEs.
You can change the launch options in the main class. The game currently only works at 1920x1080 resolution. I will try to add resolution scaling in the future. Compiled versions will be released when I am satisfied with the current state of my project.

Check ***changelog.md*** for more information on updates.   
You can also see these updates in action in my [**YouTube**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmh2cJzgZnhOsGtRkt4r6EaodniLnrPgb) channel.
