# Hollow Night

An attempt at remaking "Hollow Knight" from Team Cherry for a project aimed at improving my OOP/Java skills.

## Update 13-Feb-2022: v0.0.1
* Added collision detection for creature type entities
* Added gravity
* Added jumping ability (bugged; falling off of a platform and holding jump button mid-air will result in a jump upon impact)
* Added dashing ability (incomplete; cannot dash twice off platforms)
* Image based map generation (colorspace has to be graysale)
